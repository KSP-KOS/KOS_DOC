<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>To use this feature you <strong>must</strong> make sure you have the main game
option “Simulate in Background” turned <strong>on</strong>.  It can be found in
Kerbal Space Program’s main menu settings screen, under
“General” settings.</p>
<p>More explanation can be found further down this page in the
section titled “Simulate in Background”.</p>
</div>
<p>Telnet is an old network protocol designed in the early days of the Internet, long
before World Wide Web.  Its purpose was (is) to allow you to get access to the
remote command line interfaces of distant server computers, acting as if the
keyboard and computer screen in front of you was a terminal hooked up to a distant
computer.  kOS uses this protocol to let you
<strong>access the kOS terminal from a program outside of Kerbal Space Program</strong>.</p>
<p>There are freely available programs you can use as the telnet client to
behave like terminal windows outside of the KSP window.  A list of them appears below
in the section called <a class="reference internal" href="#telnet-clients">Telnet clients</a>.</p>
<p>There are some <em>security implications</em> of enabling the kOS telnet server, and the
first time you turn it on you will see some warning messages to this effect.
If you want to read further about these concerns before deciding to turn it
on, see the section called “<a class="reference internal" href="#security">Security</a>” at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Telnet clients</a><a class="headerlink" href="#telnet-clients" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The telnet server for kOS requires the use of a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telnet.org/htm/applications.htm">telnet client program</a>. We
recommend the following programs, although you can use others:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>For Windows</dt><dd><p>We recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://www.putty.org/">Putty</a>, the free terminal emulator
for Windows, although any good terminal emulator should do the job,
provided it is capable of operating in an “XTERM - compatible” mode.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For Mac</dt><dd><p>You shouldn’t have to install anything.  There should be a telnet client
already installed, which you can access by opening up your command terminal,
and then running it as a command-line tool.  To see how to use it, read
below in the section titled “<a class="reference internal" href="#howto-command-line-client">HOWTO: Command-line client</a>”.  The built-in
Terminal.app for OSX understands the XTERM command sequences that kOS uses
and in fact identifies itself as a type of XTERM when used with a telnet
client.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For Linux</dt><dd><p>You shouldn’t have to install anything.  There should be a telnet client
already installed, and an xterm program already installed in most any Linux
distribution.  Open an xterm window, and in that window type the telnet
command, as described by the section titled “<a class="reference internal" href="#howto-command-line-client">HOWTO: Command-line client</a>”</p>
</dd>

<section id="simulate-in-background">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Simulate in Background</a><a class="headerlink" href="#simulate-in-background" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To use the kOS telnet feature, you must have the stock KSP game’s
option called “Simulate in Background” turned on.  This option
is found on Kerbal Space Program’s “General” settings screen
(Note, this is the settings screen you find on the
<em>title screen</em> of the game, NOT the smaller subset of settings
you find on the “escape” menu in-game.)</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because when that option is turned off, the entire KSP
game is paused any time you switch focus to a different program
on your computer other than KSP.  When the game is thusly paused,
the kOS telnet server inside the game is frozen and can’t respond
to anything the telnet client sends it.  (If you are typing into a
telnet client program on your computer, then <em>that</em> will be the
the focussed window instead of the KSP game, so this issue will
come up the majority of the time.)</p>

<li><p>It is possible to have multiple terminals hooked up to the same in-game CPU.  They

(For example a pair of people could execute the “stage.” command by having one
of them type “st”, then the other types “age”, followed by the first person
typing “.” and the return key.)  All the keyboards and all the screens are
slaved together to be equal.  You can view the in-game gui terminal while
somebody is typing on a telnet temrinal.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to make the terminals act as clones of each other, the game will attempt
to keep them all the same size.  If you resize your telnet client window, it should
cause the in-game window to change size to match.  (If your terminal type is XTERM,
then the same thing works in reverse.  If it’s VT100 then it doesn’t.)</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Certain implementations of the xterm terminal emulation and the telnet client have
created a strange unending cascade of terminal resizes when you have two different
telnet clients connected to the same GUI terminal and one of them is dragged to a
new size.  Because some implementations don’t wait until they’re done resizing to
report their new size through telnet and instead report their intermediate sizes as
they are being stretched, the attempt to keep them the same size causes them to
effectively “argue” back and forth with each other, constantly changing each
other’s size.   If you experience this problem (your terminal window will be
flipping back and forth between two different sizes, resizing itself over and over
again in a neverending loop), you can try to get out of it by issuing a hardcoded
command to set the terminal size, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">TERMINAL</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">WIDTH</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">50</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Doing this should force all the connected telnet XTERM windows to stop arguing with
each other about what the size is, and get them synced up again.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li><p>At any time you may disconnect your telnet client from the terminal by hitting
control-D as the first character of a new line.  This will bring you back to
the telnet welcome menu again.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="special-keys">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Special Keys</a><a class="headerlink" href="#special-keys" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following keys have special meaning in the telnet session:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Control-L</dt><dd><p><strong>Force refresh</strong> Pressing Control-L forces the kOS telnet server to
redraw your whole screen for you from scratch.  This is useful if
you encounter strange line noise, interrupted messages, or for
just any occasion where you suspect the screen isn’t being drawn
correctly.  Pressing control-L will ensure your display gets
fully re-synced with what’s in the buffer in memory for the
terminal.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-C</dt><dd><p><strong>interrupt process</strong> This is the same meaning as control-C in the normal
GUI terminal - it breaks the program execution.  The reason it gets a special
mention here is that it also causes a flush of all the pending input you may
have typed ahead in the queue.  If you’ve been typing blindly ahead, and then
hit Control-C, it will erase your typed-ahead keys as it sends the interrupt
to the server.  This is deliberate, and typical practice for an interrupt
character sent over a remote shell setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-D</dt><dd><p><strong>detach</strong> If you hit control-D as the first character of a new line, it will
detach your telnet session from the CPU and return you to the welcome menu.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cursor Keys</dt><dd><p><strong>should be mapped</strong> If your terminal has identified itself as one of the known
types that kOS supports, it should understand your arrow keys as arrow keys.
If you see the text “[A” when you type up-arrow, or “[C” when you type right-arrow,
this is a clue that kOS didn’t recognize your terminal type properly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Other Keys</dt><dd><p><strong>might be mapped</strong> Some keys like the Del (to the right), Home, and End keys are
often not mapped correctly in some terminal emulator programs.  If you have
trouble using HOME and END, you can try Control-A and Control-E as alternates for
Home and End.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-A</dt><dd><p><strong>home</strong> This is an alternate way to press the “home” key, just in case your terminal
emulation isn’t sending the officially understood terminal code for it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-E</dt><dd><p><strong>end</strong> This is an alternate way to press the “end” key, just in case your terminal
emulation isn’t sending the officially understood terminal code for it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-H</dt><dd><p><strong>backspace</strong> This is an alternate way to press the “backspace” key, just
in case your terminal emulation isn’t sending the officially understood
terminal code for it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Control-M</dt><dd><p><strong>Return</strong> This is an alternate way to press the “enter” or “return” key,
just in case your terminal emulation isn’t sending the officially understood

<p>(These instructions assume you use the default kOS Telnet server settings, of
the loopback address 127.0.0.1, and port number 5410.  If you’ve changed those
settings then alter the numbers you see here accordingly.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Run KSP, and get it into a scene where there exists a vessel
with at least one kOS CPU loaded into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Run Putty.</p></li>
<li><p>On the first dialog you see, click the <em>Telnet</em> radio-button selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Type in the number 127.0.0.1 in the large blank above the radio
buttons that is labeled <em>“Host Name (or IP address)”</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Type in the number 5410 in the smaller blank to the right of it

<li><p>Click the <em>Open</em> button to connect to the server.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(You can also save these settings under a name for later re-use.)</p>
<p>Step 6 is important.  Without it, Putty would just make the window disappear any
time there’s a problem, making it very hard to diagnose because you can’t see what
message the server was sending back to you just before the window went away.</p>

<p>The telnet protocol performs no encryption of its data, and as such any attempt
at securing the system using a name/password combination would have been
utterly pointless.  Rather than provide a false sense of security that’s not
really there, we decided to make it obvious that there’s no security by not
even implementing a name and password for connecting to the kOS telnet server.</p>
<p>The purpose is to make it clear that if you want to open up your kOS telnet
server, you need to be careful about how you do it.</p>
<p>The default settings that kOS ships with sets your kOS telnet server to
operate on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) so that you won’t accidentally
open anything up to the public without thinking about it and making a conscious
decision to do so.  If you don’t know what that means, it means this:
Any server that runs on the magic special address 127.0.0.1, known as “loopback”,
is incapable of taking connections from other computers besides itself.</p>
<p>In order to allow your kOS telnet server to take connections from other
computers, you will typically need to do one of two things:</p>
<p>Either set the CONFIG:IPADDRESS option to the address of your computer and then
restart your telnet server (turn it off and on again using the button on the
control panel), or (much better), set up a remote ssh tunnel that will map
from your current machine’s loopback address on the port number of your server to
some remote other computer you want to connect from, to a port on it.  The ssh
tunnel is the preferred method, but describing how to set one up is beyond the
scope of this document.  You can read more
<a class="reference external" href="http://realprogrammers.com/how_to/set_up_an_ssh_tunnel_with_putty.html">For windows</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/set-up-ssh-tunneling-on-a-linux-unix-bsd-server-to-bypass-nat/">For UNIX (both Mac and Linux)</a>.</p>
<p>Example: Let’s say you have a remote Unix machine you’d like to enable logins from,
from there and nowhere else.  You can forward from your own machine’s
127.0.0.1, port 5410, to the remote machine’s, oh let’s say 127.0.0.1, port 54100.
Then anyone on the remote machine could telnet to ITS 127.0.0.1, port 54100 and
end up talking to your machine’s port 5410 on its loopback address.</p>
<p><strong>Port forwarding</strong></p>
<p>If you opt to use a non-loopback address on your kOS telnet server, then you
will probably also, if you have a typical home network setup, need to enable
port forwarding on your router if you want people from outside your house to
connect to it.  (Again, think about the implications of doing so before you do it).
This is a topic beyond the scope of this document, but help can be found out on
the web for it.  Search for “port forward home router”.  (It is probably also a
good idea to include the make &amp; model number of your router device in your search
terms, to get a nicely narrowed result that’s exactly what you need.)</p>
<p><strong>Why not ssh?</strong></p>
<p>The original plan for kOS was to include an ssh server
instead of a telnet server.  However this proved problematic as open source
solutions in C# for the server-side of ssh were hard to come by (there’s several
for the client side only, and plenty of server-side code that’s not in C#), and
implementing the entire server side of the ssh protocol from scratch is a
daunting task that would have taken too much time away from other development
of kOS.  (While implementing from scratch the server side of the older, simpler
telnet protocol, while still work, was more doable).</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Homemade telnet clients</a><a class="headerlink" href="#homemade-telnet-clients" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section is only of interest to hobbyists making Kerbal console hardware rigs
and software developers trying to make interface mods that pretend to be
kOS terminals.  If you are neither of those two, then don’t worry if this section
looks like gibberish to you.  It can be skipped.</p>
<p><strong>TELNET PROTOCOL</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to make your own homemade telnet client and connect it up to the
kOS telnet server, the following is the required subset of the telnet protocol
that your telnet client must speak, and the terminal requirements it must
fulfill:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It must suppress local character echoing, and enter character-at-a-time mode,
by implementing both the ECHO negotiation
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc857.txt">described by RFC857</a>, and
the SUPPRESS GO AHEAD negotiation
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc858.txt">described by RFC858</a>. These are
used in the following way:  Your client must NOT ECHo (letting the server do it),
and your client must suppress go-ahead messages (allowing real-time back-and-forth).</p></li>
<li><p>It must implement the underlying DO/DONT and WILL/WONT, and SB/SE infrastructure of
the main <a class="reference external" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc854.txt">telnet RFC854</a>.  It must
send break (ctrl-C) as the IP interrupt process command (byte 255 followed by 244).
kOS does not use much of the negotiations of the protocol mentioned on RFC854, other
than those that are necessary to enable the other ones mentioned here.</p></li>
<li><p>It must implement the Terminal-Type option
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc1091.txt">described by RFC1091</a>.
Furthermore, as of this writing, kOS only knows how to understand two terminal types,
“XTERM”, and “VT100”.  If your terminal type is identified as anything else, kOS
may deny your connection, or at the very least just not work right.  Even terminals
that are capable of emulating XTERM or VT100 commands won’t work right if they
don’t identify themselves as XTERM or VT100.  kOS does not know how to guess what
emulation mode to enter if it doesn’t recognize your terminal type string.</p></li>
<li><p>It must implement the NAWS, Negotiate About Terminal Size option, as
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc1073.txt">described by RFC1073</a>.
kOS uses this to decide how to size its mental image of your terminal to match
your terminal’s real size.  Note that this negotiation is one-way.  Your client
can use it to tell the server about its size, but the server can’t use it to
tell your client to change its size.  Instead if your client can respond to changing
sizes at the behest of the server, it must do so through terminal escape code
characters sent back to it on the stream, above the telnet protocol layer itself.
(For example, if you identify as XTERM, you will be sent the XTERM escape code
pattern ESC [ 8 ; <em>height</em> ; <em>width</em> t, which is the XTERM escape code for setting
the terminal size.)  This is because the telnet protocol was never written to
accommodate the concept of server-initiated resizes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Making a telnet client from scratch that actually follows protocol may be a complex
enough task that the smarter solution is to just use an existing telnet program, if
you are trying to create some sort of hardware rig.  These days a small cheap
mini-hardware implementation of Linux should be doable, and could include the
telnet client installed in it for very little storage cost.</p>
<p><strong>TERMINAL EMULATION</strong></p>
<p>As of right now, the terminal emulation of kOS only really supports XTERM
or VT100 well, however the infrastructure is in place to support modifications
to map to other terminal types.  If you want to try a hand at adding the
terminal emulation for a currently unsupported terminal, you’d do it
by subclassing the kOS.UserIO.TerminalUnicodeMapper class.  You can
look at kOS.UserIO.TerminalXtermMapper as a sample to see what you need
to do.</p>
<p>If you have a project where you want to just work with the terminal
codes already supported, then these are the subset you need to support:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><em>ASCII</em></dt><dd><p>The following terms should have their normal ASCII meaning:</p>
</dd>
<dt>0x08 (control-H)</dt><dd><p>backspace key</p>
</dd>
<dt>0x0d (control-M)</dt><dd><p>Return key.  On output it means go to left edge but don’t go down a line.
A typical eoln needs to occur using its ASCII standard of both a
return character 0x0d AND a linefeed character 0x0a</p>
</dd>
<dt>0x0a (control-J)</dt><dd><p>On output it means go to go down a line but don’t go to the left edge

Note this is NOT a typo that it uses a right-square-bracket (“]”) here where
all the other codes used a left-square-bracket (“[“).  That’s actually
how the xterm control sequence for this really looks.</p>
