<h2 id="list-of-bound-variable-names">LIST OF BOUND VARIABLE NAMES</h2>

<p>This is the list of special reserved keyword variable names that kOS will interpret
to mean something special.  If they are used as normal variable names by your kOS script
program they may not work.  Understanding them and their meaning is crucial to creating
effective kOS scripts.</p>

<h2 id="resource-types">Resource Types</h2>

<p>Any time there is a resource on the ship it can be queried.  The resources are the values that appear when you click on the upper-right corner of the screen in the KSP window. <img src="../images/resources.png" alt="Resources" /></p>

<pre><code>LIQUIDFUEL
OXIDIZER
ELECTRICCHARGE
MONOPROPELLANT
INTAKEAIR
SOLIDFUEL
</code></pre>

<p>All of the above resources can be queried using either the prefix SHIP or STAGE, depending on whether you are trying to query how much is left in the curent stage or the entire ship:</p>

<p>How much liquid fuel is left in the entire ship:</p>

<pre><code>PRINT "There is " + SHIP:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel on the ship.".
</code></pre>

<p>How much liquid fuel is left in just the current stage:</p>

<pre><code>PRINT "There is " + STAGE:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel in this stage.".
</code></pre>

<p>How much liquid fuel is left in the target vessel:</p>

<pre><code>PRINT "There is " + TARGET:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel in the target ship.".
</code></pre>

<p>Any other resources that you have added using other mods should be query-able this way, provided that you spell
the term exactly as it appears in the resources window.</p>

<h2 id="alt-alias">ALT ALIAS</h2>

<h2 id="encounter">ENCOUNTER</h2>

<p>The body being encountered next by the current vessel.  Returns the special string "None" if there is no expected encounter, or an object of type <a href="../structures/body/index.html">Body</a> if an encounter is expected.</p>

<h2 id="boolean-toggle-fields">BOOLEAN TOGGLE FIELDS:</h2>

<p>These are variables that behave like boolean flags.  They can be True or False, and can be set or toggled
using the "ON" and "OFF" and "TOGGLE" commands.
Many of these are for action group flags.
<strong>NOTE ABOUT ACTION GROUP FLAGS:</strong> If the boolean flag is for an action group, be aware that each time the
user presses the action group keypress, it <em>toggles</em> the action group, so you might need to check for both
the change in state from false to true AND the change in state from true to false to see if the key was hit.</p>

<p>TIME is the time since the entire saved game campaign started, in the kerbal universe's time.  i.e. TIME = 0  means a brand new campaign was just started.</p>

<p>TIME is a useful system variable for calculating the passage of time between taking
physical measurements (i.e. to calulate how fast a phenomenon is changing in a loop).
It returns the KSP <em>simulated</em> time, rather than the actual realtime sitting in the
chair playing the game.  If everything is running smoothly on a fast computer, one
second of simulated time will match one second of real time, but if anything is
causing the game to stutter or lag a bit, then the simulated time will be a bit
slower than the real time.  For any script program trying to calculate physical
properties of the KSP universe, the time that matters is the simulated time, which
is what TIME returns.</p>

<p>It's important to be aware of the <a href="../summary_topics/CPU_hardware/index.html#FROZEN">frozen update nature</a> of the kOS computer when reading TIME.</p>
