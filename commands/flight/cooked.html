<p>Like all <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></code> expressions, the steering and throttle continually update on their own when using this style of control. If you lock your steering to velocity, then as your velocity changes, your steering will change to match it. Unlike with other <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></code> expressions, the steering and throttle are special in that the lock expression gets executed automatically all the time in the background, while other <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span></code> expressions only get executed when you try to read the value of the variable. The reason is that the <strong>kOS</strong> computer is constantly querying the lock expression multiple times per second as it adjusts the steering and throttle in the background.</p>

<dd><p><strong>(For Rovers)</strong> This is used to control the throttle that is used when
driving a wheeled vehicle on the ground.  It is an entirely independent
control from the flight throttle used with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LOCK</span> <span class="pre">THROTTLE</span></code> above.
It is analogous to holding the &#8216;W&#8217; (value of +1) or &#8216;S&#8217; (value of -1)

<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELTHROTTLE</span></code> allows you to set

A negative value means you are trying to accelerate in reverse.</p>
<p>Unlike trying to drive manually, using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WHEELTHROTTLE</span></code> in kOS does
not cause the torque wheels to engage as well.  In stock KSP using
the &#8216;W&#8217; or &#8216;S&#8217; keys on a rover engages both the wheel driving AND the
torque wheel rotational power.  In kOS those two features are
done independently.</p>

<code class="descname">LOCK WHEELSTEERING TO expression.</code></dt>
<dd><p><strong>(For Rovers)</strong> This is used to tell the rover&#8217;s cooked steering
where to go.  The rover&#8217;s cooked steering doesn&#8217;t use nearly as
sophisticated a PID control system as the flight cooked steering
does, but it does usually get the job done, as driving has more
physical effects that help dampen the steering down automatically.</p>
<p>There are 3 kinds of value understood by WHEELSTEERING:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../../math/geocoordinates.html#structure:GEOCOORDINATES" title="GEOCOORDINATES structure"><code class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">GeoCoordinates</span></code></a> - If you lock wheelsteering to a
<code class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">GetCoordinates</span></code>, that will mean the rover will try to steer in
whichever compass direction will aim at that location.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/vessels/vessel.html#structure:VESSEL" title="VESSEL structure"><code class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">Vessel</span></code></a> - If you try to lock wheelsteering to a vessel,
that will mean the rover will try to steer in whichever compass
direction will aim at that vessel.  The vessel being aimed at
does not need to be landed.  If it is in the sky, the rover will
attempt to aim at a location directly underneath it on the ground.</li>
<li><em>Scalar Number</em> - If you try to lock wheelsteering to just a plain
scalar number, that will mean the rover will try to aim at that
compass heading.  For example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock</span> <span class="pre">wheelsteering</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">45.</span></code> will
try to drive the rover northeast.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more precise control over steering, you can use raw steering to
just directly tell the rover to yaw left and right as it drives and
that will translate into wheel steering provided the vessel is landed
and you have a probe core aiming the right way.</p>
<p><strong>A warning about WHEELSTEERING and vertically mounted probe cores</strong>:</p>
<p>If you built your rover in such a way that the probe core controlling it
is stack-mounted facing up at the sky when the rover is driving, that
will confuse the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock</span> <span class="pre">WHEELSTEERING</span></code> cooked control mechanism.  This
is a common building pattern for KSP players and it seems to work okay
when driving manually, but when driving by a kOS script, the fact that
the vessel&#8217;s facing is officially pointing up at the sky causes it to
get confused.  If you notice that your rover tends to drive in the
correct direction only when on a flat or slight downslope, but then
turns around and around in circles when driving toward the target
requires going up a slope, then this may be exactly what&#8217;s happening.
When it tilted back, the &#8216;forward&#8217; vector aiming up at the sky started
pointing behind it, and the cooked steering thought the rover was
aimed in the opposite direction to the way it was really going.
To fix this problem, either mount your rover probe core facing the
front of the rover, or perform a &#8220;control from here&#8221; on some forward
facing docking port or something like that to get it to stop thinking
of the sky as &#8220;forward&#8221;.</p>

<p class="last">It&#8217;s a very bad idea to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> during the execution of the expression in a

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Don&#8217;t &#8216;WAIT&#8217; during cooked control calculation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-wait-during-cooked-control-calculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Be aware that because LOCK THROTTLE, LOCK STEERING, LOCK
WHEELTHROTTLE, and LOCK WHEELSTEERING are actually
<a class="reference internal" href="../../general/cpu_hardware.html#triggers"><span>triggers</span></a> that cause your expression
to be calculated every single physics update tick behind
the scenes, you should not execute a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> command
in the code that performs the evaluation of the value
used in them, as that will effectively cheat the entire
script out of the full execution speed it deserves.</p>
<p>For example, if you attempt this:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nv">get_throttle</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">wait</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">001</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="c1">// this line is a bad idea.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">5</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">lock</span> <span class="nv">throttle</span> <span class="ow">to</span> <span class="nv">get_throttle</span><span class="p">().</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then kOS will attempt to call the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WAIT</span></code> command <em>every single</em>
update, as the kOS system keeps trying to re-run the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lock</span> <span class="pre">throttle</span></code> expression to learn what you want the new
throttle value to be. This will starve your script of the
CPU time it deserves, having the effect of running the
lock function every-other-tick, and the rest of your code
every-other-tick on the ticks in-between.  (When the system
hits the wait inside the throttle expression, it will stop
there, not resuming until the next update, effectively meaning
it doesn&#8217;t get around to running any of your main-line code
until the next tick.)</p>
<p>Normally when you use a LOCK command, the expression is only evaluated
when it needs to be by some other part of the script that is trying
to read the value.  But with these special cooked control locks,
remember that the kOS system <em>itself</em> will query the value repeatedly
in the background so it knows how to adjust the piloting.  Unlike
normal LOCKs, these LOCKs will be executed again and again even when
you&#8217;re not explicitly trying to get their values.</p>

<p>While cooked steering tries to come balanced to perform decently without user
interaction, there are some instances where you may need to help tune the
behavior.  There are a number of settings you can adjust to tweak the
behavior of the cooked steering if it&#8217;s not performing exactly as you&#8217;d
like.  It may be the case that making your own control mechanism from

<h3>Some simple suggestions to try fixing common problems<a class="headerlink" href="#some-simple-suggestions-to-try-fixing-common-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to understand the intricate details of the cooked
steering system, here&#8217;s some quick suggestions for changes to the
settings that might help solve some problems, in the list below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>problem</strong>: A large vessel with low torque doesn&#8217;t seem to be even trying to
rotate very quickly.  The controls may be fluctuating around the zero point,
but it doesn&#8217;t seem to want to even try to turn faster.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:MAXSTOPPINGTIME</cite> to about 5 or
10 seconds or so.  Also, slightly increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHPID:KD</cite>
and <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWPID:KD</cite> to about 1 or 2 as well to go with it.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: Once the steering manager gets such a ship rotating at
a tiny rate, it stops trying to make it rotate any faster than that
because it&#8217;s &#8220;afraid&#8221; of allowing it to obtain a larger momentum than it
thinks it could quickly stop.  It needs to be told that in this case
it&#8217;s okay to build up more &#8220;seconds worth&#8221; of rotational velocity.  The
reason for increasing the Kd term as well is to tell it to anticipate
the need to starting slowing down rotation sooner than it normally
would.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: A vessel seems to reasonably come to the desired direction
sensibly, but once it&#8217;s there the ship vibrates back and forth by about 1
degree or less excessively around the setpoint.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHTS</cite> and
<cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWTS</cite> to several seconds.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: Once it&#8217;s
at the desired orientation and it has mostly zeroed the rotational
velocity, it&#8217;s trying to hold it there with microadjustments to the
controls, and those microadjustments are &#8220;too tight&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: The vessel&#8217;s nose seems to be waving slowly back and forth
across the set direction, taking too long to center on it, and you notice
the control indicators are pushing all the way to the extremes as it does
so.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Increase <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHPID:KD</cite> and
<cite>STEERINGMANGER:YAWPID:KD</cite>.</li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: The ship is <em>trying</em> to
push its rotation rate too high when almost at the setpoint.  It needs
to anticipate the fact that it is going to reach the desired direction
and start slowing down BEFORE it gets there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>problem</strong>: The vessel&#8217;s nose seems to be waving slowly back and forth across
the set direction, taking too long to center on it, but you notice that the
control indicators are NOT pushing all the way to the extremes as it does
so.  Instead they seem to be staying low in magnitude, wavering around zero
and may be getting smaller over time.<ul>
<li><strong>solution</strong>: Decrease <cite>STEERINGMANAGER:PITCHTS</cite> and/or
<cite>STEERINGMANAGER:YAWTS</cite></li>
<li><strong>explanation</strong>: While larger values for the
settling time on the Torque PID controller will help to smooth out
spikes in the controls, it also results in a longer time period before
the steering comes to a rest at the setpoint (also knows as settling).
If you had previously increased the settling time to reduce
oscillations, try picking a value half way between the default and the
new value you previously selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But to understand how to tune the cooked steering in a more complex way than
just with that simple list, you first have to understand what a PID controller
is, at least a little bit, so you know what the settings you can tweak
actually do.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what a PID controller is and want to learn more, you can
read numerous descriptions of the concept on the internet that can be found
in moments by a web search.  If you just want to know a two minute explanation
for the sake of tuning the cooked steering a bit, read on.</p>

<div class="section" id="quick-and-dirty-description-of-a-pid-controller">
<h3>Quick and Dirty description of a PID controller<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-and-dirty-description-of-a-pid-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can think of a PID controller as a magic mathematical black box that can
learn where to set a control lever in order to achieve a given goal.  A good
example of this is cruise control on a car.  You tell the cruise control
what speed you&#8217;d like it to maintain, and it attempts to move the accelerator
pedal to the necessary position that will maintain that constant speed.</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell is the goal of a PID controller - to perform tasks
like that.  You have control over a lever or dial of some sort, and it
indirectly affects a phenomenon you can measure, and you feed the
mathematical black box of the PID controller the measurement of the
phenomenon, and obey its instructions of where to set the control lever.
Over time, the PID controller, under the assumption that you are obeying
its instructions of where to set the control lever, learns how to fine
tune its commands about how to set the lever to get the measurement to
settle on the value you asked for.</p>
<p>A more complex discussion of PID controllers than that is outside the
scope of this document, but you can check out <a class="reference internal" href="../../tutorials/pidloops.html#pidloops"><span>the PID Loop tutorial.</span></a></p>

<h3>Cooked Steering&#8217;s use of PID controllers<a class="headerlink" href="#cooked-steering-s-use-of-pid-controllers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<span id="cooked-omega-pid"></span><h4>The Rotational Velocity PID<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rotational-velocity-pid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first PID controller looks at the current direction the ship is pointed,
versus the direction the ship is meant to be pointed, and uses the offset
between the two to decide how to set the desired rotational velocity (rate
at which the angle is changing).</p>
<p>The suffixes to <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><span>SteeringManager</span></a> allow direct
manipulation of the rotational velocity&#8217;s PID tuning parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-torque-pid">
<span id="cooked-torque-pid"></span><h4>The Torque PID<a class="headerlink" href="#the-torque-pid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>But there is no such thing as a lever that directly controls the rotational
velocity.  What there is, is a lever that directly controls the rotational
<em>acceleration</em>.  When you pull on the yoke (i.e. hold down the &#8220;S&#8221; key),
you are telling the ship to either rotate <em>faster</em>  or <em>slower</em> than it
already is.</p>
<p>So given a result from the Rotational Velocity PID, with a desired
rotational velocity to seek, the second PID controller takes over,
the Torque PID, which uses that information to choose how to set
the actual controls themselves (i.e. the WASDQE controls) to accelerate
toward that goal rotational velocity.</p>
<p>The suffixes to <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><span>SteeringManager</span></a> don&#8217;t quite
allow direct manipulation of the torque PID tuning parameters Kp, Ki,
and Kd, because they are calculated indirectly from the ship&#8217;s own
attributes.  However, there are several suffixes to
<a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#steeringmanager"><span>SteeringManager</span></a> that allow you to make
indirect adjustments to them that are used in calculating the values
it uses for Kp, Ki, and Kd.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This technique of using two different PID controllers, the first one
telling the second one which seek value to use, and the second one
actually being connected to the control &#8220;lever&#8221;, is one of many ways of dealing
with a phenomenon with two levels of indirection from the control.</p>
<p>Keeping the above two things separate, the rotational velocity PID
versus the Torque PID, is important in knowing which setting
you need to tweak in order to achieve the desired effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-pair-of-pid-s-per-axis-of-rotation">
<h4>One pair of PID&#8217;s per axis of rotation<a class="headerlink" href="#one-pair-of-pid-s-per-axis-of-rotation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The above pair of controllers is replicated per each of the 3 axes of
rotation, for a total of 6 altogether.  Some of the settings you can
adjust affect all 3 axes together, while others are specific to just
one.  See the descriptions of each setting carefully to know which is
which.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="corrects-2-axes-first-then-the-3rd">
<h4>Corrects 2 axes first, then the 3rd<a class="headerlink" href="#corrects-2-axes-first-then-the-3rd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The cooked steering tries to correct first the pitch and yaw, to aim
the rocket at the desired pointing vector, then only after it&#8217;s very
close to finishing that task does it allow the 3rd axis, the roll axis,
to correct itself.  This is because if you try correcting all three at
the same time, it causes the cooked steering to describe a curved arc
toward its destination orientation, rather than rotating straight
towards it.</p>
<p>This behavior is correct for rockets with radial symmetry, but is
probably a bit wrong for trying to steer an airplane to a new heading
while in atmosphere.  For flying an airplane to a new heading, it&#8217;s
still best to make your own control scheme from scratch with raw steering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-settings-to-change">
<h4>The settings to change<a class="headerlink" href="#the-settings-to-change" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>First, you can modify how kOS decides how fast the ship should turn:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// MAXSTOPPINGTIME tells kOS how to calculate the maximum allowable</span>
<span class="c1">// angular velocity the Rotational Velocity PID is allowed to output.</span>
<span class="c1">// Increasing the value will result in the ship turning</span>
<span class="c1">// faster, but it may introduce more overshoot.</span>
<span class="c1">// Adjust this setting if you have a small amount of torque on a large mass,</span>
<span class="c1">// or if your ship appears to oscillate back and forth rapidly without</span>
<span class="c1">// moving towards the target direction.</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">MAXSTOPPINGTIME</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">10</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="c1">// You can also modify the PID constants that calculate desired angular</span>
<span class="c1">// velocity based on angular error, in the angular velocity PID controller.</span>
<span class="c1">// Note that changes made directly to the PIDLoop&#39;s MINIMUM and MAXIMUM</span>
<span class="c1">// suffixes will be overwritten based on the value MAXSTOPPINGTIME, the</span>
<span class="c1">// ship&#39;s torque and moment of inertia.</span>
<span class="c1">// These values will require precision and testing to ensure consistent</span>
<span class="c1">// performance.</span>
<span class="c1">// Beware of large KD values: Due to the way angular velocity and part</span>
<span class="c1">// facing directions are calculated in KSP, it is normal to have small rapid</span>
<span class="c1">// fluctuations which may introduce instability in the derivative component.</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">PITCHPID</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">KP</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">85</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">PITCHPID</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">KI</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mf">5</span><span class="p">.</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Second, you can change how the controls are manipulated to achieve the desired
angular velocity.  This is for the Torque PID mentioned above.  Internally,
kOS uses the ship&#8217;s available torque and moment of inertial to dynamically
calculate the PID constants.  Then the desired torque is calculated based on
the desired angular velocity.  The steering controls are then set based on
the the percentage the desired torque is of the available torque.  You can
change the settling time for the torque calculation along each axis:</p>
<div class="highlight-kerboscript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Increase the settling time to slow down control reaction time and</span>
<span class="c1">// reduce control spikes.  This is helpful in vessels that wobble enough to</span>
<span class="c1">// cause fluctuations in the measured angular velocity.</span>
<span class="c1">// This is recommended if your ship turns towards the target direction well</span>
<span class="c1">// but then oscillates when close to the target direction.</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">PITCHTS</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">10</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="k">SET</span> <span class="nv">STEERINGMANAGER</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">ROLLTS</span> <span class="ow">TO</span> <span class="mf">5</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you find that kOS is regularly miscalculating the available torque, you can
also define an adjust bias, or factor.  Check out these <a class="reference internal" href="../../structures/misc/steeringmanager.html#structure:STEERINGMANAGER" title="STEERINGMANAGER structure"><code class="xref ks ks-struct docutils literal"><span class="pre">SteeringManager</span></code></a>
suffixes for more details: PITCHTORQUEADJUST, YAWTORQUEADJUST, ROLLTORQUEADJUST,
PITCHTORQUEFACTOR, YAWTORQUEFACTOR, ROLLTORQUEFACTOR</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advantages-disadvantages">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Advantages/Disadvantages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-disadvantages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The advantage of &#8220;Cooked&#8221; control is that it is simpler to write scripts
for, but the disadvantage is that you have only partial control over
the details of the motion.</p>
<p>Cooked controls perform best on ships that do not rely heavily on control
surfaces, have medium levels of torque, and are structurally stable.  You can
improve the control by placing the ship&#8217;s root part or control part close to the
center of mass (preferably both).  Adding struts to critical joints (like
decouplers) or installing a mod like Kerbal Joint Reinforcement will also help.</p>
<p>But because of the impossibility of finding one setting that is universally
correct for all possible vessels, sometimes the only way to make cooked
steering work well for you is to adjust the parameters as described above,
or to make your own steering control from scratch using raw steering.</p>
