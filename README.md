This master branch is the source for the github pages site, There will be more documentation around how to contribute soon.

### Good news: now splitting RELEASE and PRE-RELEASE docs!
This had been a problem before because the doc-editing markdown system called MiddleMan doesn't like letting you
make multiple branches of the source files, making it hard to have a separate pre-release version of the docs.
This has been solved now by simply using an entirely different fork for the pre-release version.


The RELEASE docs can be viewed @ http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/

The PRE-RELEASE docs can be viewed @ http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC_DEV/
