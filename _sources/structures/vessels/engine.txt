Engine
======

Some of the Parts returned by :ref:`LIST PARTS <list command>` will be of type Engine. It is also possible to get just the Engine parts by executing ``LIST ENGINES``, for example::

    LIST ENGINES IN myVariable.
    FOR eng IN myVariable {
        print "An engine exists with ISP = " + eng:ISP.
    }.

.. note::

    :struct:`Engine` is a type of :struct:`Part`, and therefore can use all the suffixes of :struct:`Part`. Shown below are only the suffixes that are unique to :struct:`Engine`.



.. method:: Engine:ACTIVATE

    Call to make the engine turn on.

.. method:: Engine:SHUTDOWN

    Call to make the engine turn off.

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUSTLIMIT

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: scalar (%)

    If this an engine with a thrust limiter (tweakable) enabled, what percentage is it limited to?

.. _engine_MAXTHRUST:

.. attribute:: Engine:MAXTHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (kN)

    How much thrust would this engine give at its current atmospheric pressure and velocity if the throttle was max at 1.0, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the engine's actual max thrust it could have under other air pressure conditions.  Some engines have a very different value for MAXTHRUST in vacuum as opposed to at sea level pressure.  Also, some jet engines have a very different value for MAXTHRUST depending on how fast they are currently being rammed through the air.

.. _engine_MAXTHRUSTAT:

.. method:: Engine:MAXTHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: scalar (kN)

    How much thrust would this engine give if both the throttle and thrust limtier was max at the current velocity, and at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0.0 for vacuum, and 1.0 for sea level (on Kerbin) (or more than 1 for thicker atmospheres like on Eve).

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (kN)

    How much thrust is this engine giving at this very moment.

.. _engine_AVAILABLETHRUST:

.. attribute:: Engine:AVAILABLETHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and atmospheric pressure and velocity conditions.

.. _engine_AVAILABLETHRUSTAT:

.. method:: Engine:AVAILABLETHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: scalar (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and velocity, but at a different atmospheric pressure you pass into it.  The pressure is measured in ATM's, meaning 0.0 is a vacuum, 1.0 is seal level at Kerbin.

.. attribute:: Engine:FUELFLOW

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (Liters/s? maybe)

    Rate at which fuel is being burned. Not sure what the units are.

.. attribute:: Engine:ISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_

.. method:: Engine:ISPAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: scalar

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_ at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0 for vacuum, and 1 for sea level (on Kerbin).

.. attribute:: Engine:VACUUMISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    Vacuum `specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_

.. attribute:: Engine:VISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

.. attribute:: Engine:SLISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    Synonym for :SEALEVELISP

.. attribute:: Engine:FLAMEOUT

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this engine failed because it is starved of a resource (liquidfuel, oxidizer, oxygen)?

.. attribute:: Engine:IGNITION

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Has this engine been ignited? If both :attr:`Engine:IGNITION` and :attr:`Engine:FLAMEOUT` are true, that means the engine could start up again immediately if more resources were made available to it.

.. attribute:: Engine:ALLOWRESTART

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this an engine that can be started again? Usually True, but false for solid boosters.

.. attribute:: Engine:ALLOWSHUTDOWN

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this an engine that can be shut off once started? Usually True, but false for solid boosters.

    Is this an engine that is stuck at a fixed throttle? (i.e. solid boosters)
    
.. attribute:: Engine:MULTIMODE

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Does this engine have multiple modes (i.e. RAPIER)? Check this before calling multi-mode specific suffixes.   
    
.. attribute:: Engine:MODES

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`List` of strings

    Lists names of modes of this engine if multimode, returns a list of 1 string "Single mode" otherwise.   

.. attribute:: Engine:MODE

    :access: Get only
    :type: string

    Name of the current mode. Only assessible for multi-mode engines.

.. method:: Engine:TOGGLEMODE

    Call to switch to another mode. Only assessible for multi-mode engines.  

.. attribute:: Engine:PRIMARYMODE

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: boolean

    True for primary mode, false for secondary. Setting to other value equals toggling the mode. Only assessible for multi-mode engines. 

.. attribute:: Engine:AUTOSWITCH

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: boolean

    Is automatic switching enabled? Can set to switch between manual and automatic switching. Only assessible for multi-mode engines. 

.. attribute:: Engine:HASGIMBAL

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Does this engine have a gimbal enabled?

.. attribute:: Engine:GIMBAL

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`Gimbal`

    Returns the :struct:`Gimbal` attached to this engine. Only accessible if the gimbal is present (Use :attr:`Engine:HASGIMBAL` to check if available).
